# HU Kaggle Competition – Clothing Returns Prediction
For the Business Analytics and Data Science course at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, there was a data science competition on Kaggle. The target was to predict customers who posed a hightened risk of returning their order. For this task, machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, XGBoost, Early-Stopping Neural Networks, and Emsembles of these algorithms were used.

Final code is in the 'final_code directory' and is separated between the data cleaning script and the modeling script. All code was written in Python within the Atom / Hydrogen Jupyter Notebook environment.

My efforts earned me position 4 of 118 in the class.
