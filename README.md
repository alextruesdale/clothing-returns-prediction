# HU Kaggle Competition – Clothing Returns Prediction
For the Business Analytics and Data Science course at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, there was a data science competition on Kaggle. The target was to predict customers who posed a hightened risk of returning their order. For this task, machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests, XGBoost, Early-Stopping Neural Networks, and Emsembles of these algorithms were used. Scoring was based on AUC predictive accuracy for the competition. After the competition and for the final iteration of the project, a price sensitive cost function is employed to look at the real-world business tradeoff between:
- Falsely determining a customer as a non-returner and selling to a customer who returns the item.

- Being overly conservative and not making sales to incorrectly classified customers who would have otherwise kept their items.

Final code is in the 'final_code directory' and is separated between the data cleaning script and the modeling script. All code was written in Python within the Atom / Hydrogen Jupyter Notebook environment.

My efforts earned me position 4 of 118 in the class.
